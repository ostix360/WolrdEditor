 * This class is an abstract class that represents an algorithm used to perform the broad-phase of a collision detection. The goal of the broad-phase algorithm is to compute the pair of bodies that
 * can collide. It's important to understand that the broad-phase doesn't only compute body pairs that can collide, but could those that don't collide but are very close. The goal of the broad-phase
 * is to remove pairs of body that cannot collide in order to reduce the quantity of bodies to be tested in the narrow-phase.
